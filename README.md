The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment
of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru
being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.
With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing
day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with
established restaurants.
