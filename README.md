# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants

The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment
of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru
being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.
With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasâ€™nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing
day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with
established restaurants.

### if want to use the model registry feature, we need a database.

#### _If you have MySQL installed then you can use the below command:_

1. Create a database to use as an MLflow backend tracking server.

`CREATE DATABASE mlflow_tracking_database;`

2. Start MLflow tracking server using MySQL as a backend tracking store.

`mlflow server \
   --backend-store-uri  mysql+pymysql://root@localhost/mlflow_tracking_database \ 
   --default-artifact-root  file:/./mlruns \
   -h 0.0.0.0 -p 5000`


3. Set the MLflow tracking uri (within code section).

  mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5000")

#### _If you have sqlite installed then you can use the below command:_

1. Start MLflow tracking server using sqlite as a backend tracking store.

`mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db --default-artifact-root ./artifacts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5001`


2. Set the MLflow tracking uri (within code section).
    
    `mlflow.set_tracking_uri("http://localhost:5001")`
